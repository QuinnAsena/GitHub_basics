# Overview - (◕‿◕✿)

.pull-left[

- Git is a version control system for items like source code.

- Git is not for data storage although GitHub does have an option for large file storage (Git LFS).

- Git and GitHub are different things. Git is the version control system, GitHib is a cloud storage.

- There are alternatives to Git and GitHub. Git is commonly used.

- If all you want is a personal back-up system Git is not essential

# Git workflow - ﴾͡๏̯͡๏﴿ 


- **initialise** a local repository ('repo'). A repo is a working directory containing the files you wish to version control (e.g., a thesis, paper or analysis code).

- **add** a snapshot of the repo to a 'staging area': Tell git which changes to the repo you want to commit.

- **commit** files from the staging area. Takes a snapshot of the tracked files and stores them as a version. 
 - Each commit has a unique identifier. You can revert to a previous version of your project by using the identifier.
 - Each commit requires a commit message to write to your future self what you changed and why.

 
- **push** changes to a server such as GitHub (there are others). Upload files to a remote repo.

# Initialise - (ง'̀-'́)ง

1. Make a new directory somewhere on your computer.

2. Initialise a repo in that directory with a README.md and a .gitignore (in GitDesktop this steps 1 and 2 can be done at the same time).

 - a .gitignore file is a text file containing a list of items you *do not* want to keep track of or store (e.g., plot images generated from the source code).

 - Markdown files render in html so the README is viewed as a formatted document on a browser. I suggest using the README to outline the purpose of your code and detail problems.

3. Publish the repo to GitHub.



---

# add/commit and push - (ᵔᴥᵔ)

1. Make some changes to your README.md.

2. Add and commit the changes.

4. Push the changes to GitHub.


---
 
# Pull - (ง°ل͜°)ง

1. Edit your README.md on GitHub.

2. Pull changes to your local machine.



---

# Branching - ≧☉_☉≦

- So far we have been working on the master branch of your project.

- Branches allow you to make changes in parallel to your master branch without editing your primary working branch. Changes can be reviewed and merged to your master branch with a 'pull request'

---

# Branching - ಠ~ಠ

1. Create a branch in your Git GUI and navigate to that branch.

2. Edit your README.md and commit the changes to your new branch.

3. Create a 'pull request' to merge the changes with your master branch.


---

# Collaboration - ಠ╭╮ಠ

0. Pair up with someone.

1. GitHub go: settings -> manage access -> invite collaborator. Add each other as collaborators to your projects.

2. Clone their repository.

 - 'Clone' makes a copy of a remote repo on your local machine.

3. Make a new branch in their repo.

4. Make changes to their README.md, commit the changes to the branch and submit a pull request for them to review.

5. Review the changes they have made on your README.md and merge them with your master branch.
